# lubuntu 14.04 Release Notes

## New Features in Lubuntu 14.04.5
* Refresh hardware support in LTS releases for carefully-selected hardware.
* Roll up accumulated stable updates into updated images to reduce download requirements for new deployments.
* Maintain stability of existing installations.
* Various bugs that required updates are rolled into this update.

## System Requirements
A Pentium II or Celeron system with 128 MB of RAM is probably a bottom-line configuration that may yield slow yet usable system with a standard lubuntu desktop.

14.04 32 bit ISO require your CPU to have Physical Address Extensions, or PAE. "PAE is provided by Intel Pentium Pro and above CPUs, including all later Pentium-series processors (except most 400 MHz-bus versions of the Pentium M)." - If you have an error with Celeron M reporting "NON-PAE CPU" and would like to install Lubuntu 14.04, please see [this](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu/AdvancedMethods#Pentium_M_and_Celeron_M) page.

For PowerPC, it is known to run on a G4 running at 867MHz with 640MB RAM.

For Intel based Macs, lubuntu should run on all models.
