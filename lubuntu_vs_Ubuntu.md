 Both Lubuntu and Ubuntu share Two Major Important Things:
 
 1.    Same Core System
 2.    Same Repositories 
 
 Lubuntu and Ubuntu belong to the same family and talking about each as totally different two systems is not correct since they have some things in common. Thus, we use the same Forum Area and share many Wiki Pages.
 
 The differences between Lubuntu and Ubuntu are:
 
 1.    Different DE - Lubuntu uses LXDE while Ubuntu uses Unity as the default DE.
 2.    Different Default Applications 
 
 Other than that, they are the same. The DE is what makes Lubuntu a lightweight OS, and of course the selected applications too because we make sure to use the lightest applications which are not resource hungry. However, you are still free to use any application available in Ubuntuâ€™s repositories, as long as your computer can run it.
 
 Lubuntu is recognized as a member the Ubuntu family by the developers of Ubuntu.
